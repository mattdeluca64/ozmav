- Texture size calculation is inexact, which causes ex. "malformed" textures (ex. MM 0x30)
  - Started implementing proper calculation via glN64 source (uc_tex.c -> F3DEX2_CalcFinalTextureSize), it's not working correctly yet tho
- OoT's field, Kokiri and others try to execute Display Lists in external RAM segments - those can't be emulated by OZMAV without at least partial emulation of the console itself
